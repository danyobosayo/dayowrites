          During the 2024 winter season, an old high school friend approached me
          and my other best friend in hopes of doing collaborative freelance
          work. Apparently he had been doing videography for small-mid sized
          companies in his local area and wanted to expand into providing a
          complete digital package. Since then, we&apos;ve designed two
          professional websites that can be found here:

      <Block title="ontrack - my personal time tracking ai tool">
        <p>
          I recently became obsessed with the idea of flow state and catalysts.
          Everybody knows that their best work is done whilst in the flow state,
          but how does one reliably enter it? The easiest answer is by simply
          starting. But this brought about another issue, the brain-rot flow
          state. I rarely catch myself in deep brain-rot sessions, and these
          sessions range from 30 minutes to several hours, which costs me time
          and sanity. My solution for this is to catch what exactly leads up to
          these moments, so that I can better avoid them and be more mindful of
          the flow state catalysts that lead to deep brain-rot sessions.

          I found myself frequenting fast food restaurants, namely Chipotle and
          Cava, for the past two years of my life. And as someone who focuses on
          nutrition, I wanted to create a convenient and efficient way of
          calculating exactly what I&apos;m putting in my body.
