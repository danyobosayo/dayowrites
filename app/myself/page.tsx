            Though I attended church since I was very little, I only truly
            accepted Jesus Christ as my savior during my freshman year of
            University.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my life, I never felt a <i>dependence</i> on God. I
            simply coasted without caring about a higher purpose or honestly
            anything else for that matter. It wasn&apos;t significant to me
            whether a god truly existed of if they were even impacting my life.
            To describe myself during this point in my life: unmotivated,
            addicted to pornography & video games, and comfort seeking. I was
            also lustful, insecure, and uninspired, which only exacerbated my
            emptiness.
          </p>
          <p className="italic font-bold">So what changed?</p>
          <p>
            I had grown tired of feeling empty and unfulfilled. So I decided to
            try taking my faith seriously for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It started with reading some famous stories in the Bible, and
            eventually led to me reading the entirety of Genesis, the Gospels,
            and some Poetry as well. What I began to recognize was how
            incredible this roughly three thousand year old piece of literature
            was. Nothing had ever brought me so much peace and applicable advice
            for every qualm or burden. I slowly grew closer to God and began to
            feel the Holy Spirit dwell within me. It changed my mindset, how I
            carried myself, how I treated others, and the most incredible part
            of all, others too observed that change in me. And so I used it as
            an opportunity to share the Good News of Jesus Christ and how God
            the Father sent him to suffer a terrible death, so that he could
            overcome it and redeem all of us from eternal damnation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To describe myself today: I still make mistakes and struggle with
            insecurities. However, I sleep every night with contentment knowing
            that I have a faithful and loving God standing beside me everywhere
            I go.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I ask of you to take the qualms of life with a grain of salt.
            Because when the horizon eclipses the sun, <strong>you</strong> are
            not just another person, but so much more than that: you are
            uniquely made, loved, and cherished by our divine creator and
            savior.
